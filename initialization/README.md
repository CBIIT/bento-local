BENTO-LOCAL INITIALIZATION SCRIPT:

The Bento-Local initialization script will set up your bento-local project so it is ready to build.

Prerequisites:
  - Git: the script clones the Bento repositories from Github and requires that git be installed
  - Default values are set in default.conf and can be updated at run time if required

For a standard installation of Bento-Local you can use the default values for code branches and the provided demo data.

NOTE: the windows version of the initialization script MUST be run in a command prompt - it will not work correctly in powershell.
