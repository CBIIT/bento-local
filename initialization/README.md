BENTO-LOCAL INITIALIZATION SCRIPT:

The Bento-Local initialization script will set up your bento-local project so it is ready to build.

Prerequisites:
  - Git: this script clones the Bento repositories from Github and requires that git be installed
  - All variables required for the script are read from the .env file in the base bento-local directory

For a standard installation of Bento-Local you can use the default values for code branches and the provided demo data.
